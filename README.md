# About This Tool

This tool is designed to help partners quickly, easily, and efficiently adopt and extend JSON schemas within their own platforms. Built on top of the `remoteoss/json-schema-form` library, the codebase behind this app provides a solid foundation for rendering, validating, and handling submissions of JSON schemas.

## Key Features

- **JSON Schema Adoption**: This tool simplifies the process of adopting JSON schemas, allowing you to quickly integrate form rendering and validation based on JSON schemas.
- **Validation & Rendering**: All validation and rendering of forms are handled seamlessly by the `remoteoss/json-schema-form` library, ensuring a consistent and robust user experience.
- **Extensibility**: Partners can use this codebase as a starting point to build on top of JSON schemas, customizing it to fit their specific needs and workflows.

## App Flows

This tool includes two main example flows:

1. **Company Creation**: Demonstrates how a new company can be created within the Remote system.
2. **Employment Creation**: Shows how to set up employment for employees under a created company.

These flows represent the employer's journey up to the point where the employee receives a self-enrollment email. After this point, both the employer and employee can continue their journey on the Remote platform, which handles the ongoing employment relationship, compliance, and payroll processes.

This is a sample implementation of how you can structure similar workflows in your own applications, with all the heavy lifting around form management and validation handled by the `remoteoss/json-schema-form` library.
