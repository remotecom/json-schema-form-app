# About This Tool

This tool is designed to help partners quickly, easily, and efficiently adopt and extend JSON schemas within their own platforms. Built on top of the `remoteoss/json-schema-form` library, the codebase behind this app provides a solid foundation for rendering, validating, and handling submissions of JSON schemas.

## Key Features

- **JSON Schema Adoption**: This tool simplifies the process of adopting JSON schemas, allowing you to quickly integrate form rendering and validation based on JSON schemas.
- **Validation & Rendering**: All validation and rendering of forms are handled seamlessly by the `remoteoss/json-schema-form` library, ensuring a consistent and robust user experience.
- **Extensibility**: Partners can use this codebase as a starting point to build on top of JSON schemas, customizing it to fit their specific needs and workflows.

## JSON Schema Resources

To learn more about JSON schemas and how they can be utilized in your applications, check out the [JSON Schema Case Study by Remote](https://remoteoss.io/).

## App Flows

This tool includes two main example flows:

1. **Company Creation**: Demonstrates how a new company can be created within the Remote system.
2. **Employment Creation**: Shows how to set up employment for employees under a created company.

These flows represent the employer's journey up to the point where the employee receives a self-enrollment email. After this point, both the employer and employee can continue their journey on the Remote platform, which handles the ongoing employment relationship, compliance, and payroll processes.

This is a sample implementation of how you can structure similar workflows in your own applications, with all the heavy lifting around form management and validation handled by the `remoteoss/json-schema-form` library.

## Partnering with Remote

If you're interested in partnering with Remote, this tool demonstrates the ease with which you can integrate JSON schema-based forms and workflows into your product. By leveraging this codebase, you can offer your clients a powerful and compliant experience for managing companies and employment relationships globally.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
